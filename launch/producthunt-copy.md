## First Comment (Maker Comment)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built ShipLog because I was tired of the gap between what developers ship and what users see.

Every project I maintain had the same problem: the changelog was either months out of date, or it was a raw list of commit messages that nobody could parse.

ShipLog fixes this by sitting between your GitHub workflow and your users:

**For developers:**
- Zero effort — merge PRs as usual, changelog updates automatically
- AI writes user-facing summaries (not commit messages)
- Categorizes into features, fixes, improvements, breaking changes

**For users:**
- Clean, searchable changelog page
- Email digests (weekly/monthly)
- RSS feed
- Embeddable widget for your docs/site

**Coming soon:**
- Stripe integration (Pro tier for private repos + custom domains)
- Slack/Discord notifications
- Release grouping (version-based changelogs)

The free tier covers all features for public repos. I'd love your feedback on what would make this essential for your workflow!
